					<h4>Camera</h4>
				</div>
				
				Designing and implementing the camera was one of my main tasks as well as being one of my first times being confronted with such a mathematically focussed problem. I ended up deciding on something similar to what the more recent games have implemented: the camera will stay centered between the two players until they are a certain distance from each other. However, if they are further apart, the camera will split based on the players relative location to each other.<br>
				<br>
				The biggest challenge during all of this was making sure the players appeared in the same place on the screen during the transitions from one camera to two and vice-versa.
				
				
				<div class="skills">
					<h4>Sound</h4>
				</div>
				
				For the sound I first had to work out a system that would work for when the game is played in splitscreen because unity does not suppost multiple audio listeners very well. I ended up with a simple system that manages all sounds very easily, this also allowed me to slim down on the amount of audiosources in all of our levels. The one limitation that I had to work with, is that all sounds effects could not be three dimensional, this was fine for most things but I still ended up implementing a system that 'fakes' 3D sounds in a very basic manner.  <br>
